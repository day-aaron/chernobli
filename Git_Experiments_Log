Git Experiments Log 

22:35 10.10.2014 

Discussed w/ MH today how best to get started. He suggested a diary of sorts. OK. Here we go. To get in the habit I will alter this file at least once a day. Nest step is to store obj c and swift experiments here.

Just opened the file up via Terminal instead of Sublime Text.

I need more practice moving things. In particular, I want to put teh Ringtone Generaor code up so that we use git to manage it.

After meeting with KV tomorrow we'll make it happen. Until then, finish those damned wavs for Koen!

Suggestions from MH:

- stop using the finder
- search –> files "find" look at man page
- "grep" 
- control c (!)
- control z suspends jobs
- "jobs" is job control display
– find a primer on regular expressions 
- find a bash tutorial
